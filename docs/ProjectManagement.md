## Project management

To assure a good management of the project, we used [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/projects/58/views/1)
to guide the development process and to keep track of the progress of the project.
We also used Github Issues, to keep track of the bugs and features that were being developed, and
Pull Requests, to review the code and merge it to the main branch.

Another important part of the project management was the use of Discord to communicate with the team members and to discuss
ideas, problems, the development of the project and to help each other whenever needed.
