## Implementation

After opening the app, the user is greeted with the login page. If the user is already logged in,
he is redirected to the home page. If not, he can login with his account or create a new account.
After logging in, the user is redirected to the home page.

The home page is the main page of the app. It has a real-world map and a search bar.
The user can select a location on the search bar and the map will show him the job offers in that location.
If the user desires to see one of them, he just need to click on one of the pins drawn on the map
and a pop-up will appear that redirects the user, upon being clicked, to the job offer's information.

The user can also use the search page to do a more specific search, using filters such as
location, job type, job contract. The search page has a search bar that allows the
user to search for specific keywords like a company name.

The user can also see his profile page, where he can see and modify his profile information.

There's also the favorites page, where the user can see all the job offers he marked has favorite.

Finally, there's the help page, where the user can see some information about the app and how to use it.
