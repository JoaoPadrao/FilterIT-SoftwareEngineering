## Elevator Pitch
Job seeking can be frustrating, specially when there are so many
job offers and job search engines out there. It is hard to keep
track of job offer you found interesting and are interested in when
theres so much loose information. Filter IT fixes this for you, by
showing you the most recent job offers in the IT field, and allowing
you to save the ones you like the most. You can also filter them by your
criteria and view them in a real-world map. All of this to make your
job search easier and save you time. Filter IT, the best way to filter
your future!
